# Self Driving Car

## Overview
This project aims to develop a self-driving car using reinforcement learning techniques. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that implements the necessary algorithms and models to simulate and train a self-driving car.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - Stable_baselines3
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras
  - OpenAI Gym
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Implement reinforcement learning algorithms to train the self-driving car.
- **Simulation Environment**: Use OpenAI Gym to create and manage the simulation environment.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize Matplotlib for visualizing the car's learning process and performance metrics.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized code with clear modules for environment setup, model training, and evaluation.
